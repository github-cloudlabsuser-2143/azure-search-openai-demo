# Backend

This directory contains the backend services for the application.

## Overview

The backend services are implemented using the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) web framework. FastAPI is a modern Python web framework that is designed for building APIs quickly and efficiently. It is based on standard Python type hints, which allows for type checking and validation at runtime.

The backend services provide endpoints for the frontend to interact with the application. These services include:

- User authentication and authorization
- User profile management
- Task management
- Task tracking
- Data analytics

The backend services communicate with the frontend using RESTful APIs. The services are implemented as asynchronous functions, which allows them to handle multiple requests concurrently.

The backend services are designed to be scalable, reliable, and secure. They are implemented using best practices for web development, including input validation, error handling, and security features such as authentication and authorization.

The backend services are tested using unit and integration tests. The tests ensure that the services are working correctly and that they meet the requirements of the application.

The backend services are deployed using Docker containers. This allows them to be run in any environment that supports Docker, such as a local development environment, a staging environment, or a production environment.

The backend services are designed to be modular and extensible. They are organized into separate modules for different features, such as user management, task management, and data analytics. This makes it easy to add new features or modify existing ones without affecting the rest of the application.

The backend services are implemented using a clean architecture, which separates the business logic from the infrastructure code. This makes the services easier to understand, test, and maintain. The services are also designed to be stateless, which allows them to be scaled horizontally as needed.

The backend services are monitored and logged using tools such as Prometheus and Grafana. This allows the services to be monitored in real-time and to be alerted to any issues that may arise.


The backend services are secured using industry-standard security practices, such as HTTPS, OAuth, and JWT. This ensures that the services are protected from common security threats, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, unauthorized access, and data breaches. Additionally, regular security audits and updates are performed to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the data.

## Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the backend services.
- `config/`: Configuration files for the backend services.
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for the backend services.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version specified in `pyproject.toml`)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

### Installation

1. Navigate to the `app/backend` directory:

    ```sh
    cd app/backend
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Backend

To start the backend services, run:

```sh
python src/main.py
